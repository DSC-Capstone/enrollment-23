title: Learning and Using Causality for a Further Step of Machine Intelligence
bio: "I am an Assistant Professor at HDSI. Previously, I received my Ph.D degree from CMU. My research interests include causal discovery and inference, causality-related machine learning, and computational science."
description: "Causal information is essential in many tasks in empirical sciences and engineering. For example, in medical science, to find out an effective, reliable treatment for Alzheimerâ€™s disease, it is crucial to find the underlying genetic factors that are responsible for the disease and figure out how they jointly influence the disease. In AI, to achieve general-purpose AI with the capacity of reasoning, acting, and generalizing to novel domains or tasks, one challenge is to move beyond domain-specific pattern recognition towards the discovery and use of underlying causal relationships that produce stable and interpretable patterns across general scenarios of interest. To this end, two questions naturally arise: how can one acquire causal knowledge and, furthermore, how should we use it? Accordingly, we will focus on these two questions and study tools on (1) automated causal structure discovery from non-experimental data in complex environments, (2) advancing machine learning from the causal perspective, and (3) using or adapting causal discovery approaches to solve scientific problems."
