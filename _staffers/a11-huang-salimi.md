title: Learning and Using Causality for a Further Step of Machine Intelligence
bio: "<ul><li>Biwei Huang: I am an Assistant Professor at HDSI. Previously, I received my Ph.D degree from CMU. My research interests include causal discovery and inference, causality-related machine learning, and computational science.</li><li>My research interests are centered around advancing the field of trustworthy data analysis. I draw inspiration from my deep interest in data management, firmly believing that reliable, accessible, and well-organized data is essential for building trust in data analysis. In my research, I aim to develop methods for responsible data management and analysis to ensure transparency, fairness, reliability, and robustness in algorithmic decision-making. By adopting a data management perspective, I strive to create tools and techniques that enable human decision-makers to interpret data with greater accuracy and confidence. In my research group, we are dedicated to developing tools that enable human decision-makers with heterogeneous backgrounds to interpret data and make better-informed decisions</li></ul>"
description: "Causal information is essential in many tasks in empirical sciences and engineering. For example, in medical science, to find out an effective, reliable treatment for Alzheimerâ€™s disease, it is crucial to find the underlying genetic factors that are responsible for the disease and figure out how they jointly influence the disease. In AI, to achieve general-purpose AI with the capacity of reasoning, acting, and generalizing to novel domains or tasks, one challenge is to move beyond domain-specific pattern recognition towards the discovery and use of underlying causal relationships that produce stable and interpretable patterns across general scenarios of interest. To this end, two questions naturally arise: how can one acquire causal knowledge and, furthermore, how should we use it? Accordingly, we will focus on these two questions and study tools on (1) automated causal structure discovery from non-experimental data in complex environments, (2) advancing machine learning from the causal perspective, and (3) using or adapting causal discovery approaches to solve scientific problems."
