title: Hierarchical Latent Variable Models for Neural Data Analysis
bio: "I'm a computational neuroscientist with a research focus on data science methods for neuroscience experiments. My academic career was anything but linear. I started my undergraduate career with no interest in math and knowing nothing about neuroscience and now I teach and do reach at the intersection of both. I'm interested in closely examining the way that we ask questions using data and dreaming up new ways of extracting meaning about what we are and how brains function from the raw numbers. "
description: "Recent years have seen an explosion in the ability to routinely record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. Data analysis methods, however, have not kept pace and there are many scenarios in which structured latent variable models could provide effective and interpretable data summaries. in these capstone projects we will review the relevant neuroscience problem setting and neurophysiology, review the history of dimensionality reduction in systems neuroscience, and learn the mathematics of latent variable models. We will then develop some novel models that could be utilized in current neuroscience experiments. "
summer: "Please read Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine learning. Specifically:
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2, especially section 3 and the summary table on page 93</li>
<li>Chapter 3</li>
<li>Chapter 12</li>
<li>Chapter 10</li>
<li>Chapter 6</li>
</ul>"

prerequisites: Probabilistic modeling, optimization, and linear algebra.
time: Thursday 11AM-12PM, In-Person üìç HDSI 138
style: I'll provide a great deal of context, coaching, and direction for the project but my capstone students will need to spend time figuring things out for them selves. we'll start out slow with exercises and "home works" that will be challenging but will prepare students to think critically about their work and take on challenges as they come.
