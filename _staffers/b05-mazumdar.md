title: Diffusion Process as a Generative Model
bio: "Arya Mazumdar is an Associate Professor of Data Science in UC San Diego. Arya obtained his Ph.D. degree from University of Maryland, College Park specializing in information theory, which is the science of quantifying of information, and belongs to the intersection of statistics and engineering/computer science. Subsequently Arya was a postdoctoral scholar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an assistant professor in University of Minnesota, and an assistant followed by associate professor in University of Massachusetts Amherst. Arya is interested in aspects of statistical inference, and optimization now-a-days."
description: "Diffusion process is a mathematical model used to describe how particles spread out over time. The diffusion process starts with an initial state and then iteratively updates the state of the system by applying a series of random perturbations. Each perturbation is assumed to be small and random, and the overall behavior of the system emerges as a result of the accumulation of these random perturbations. This has found an application in artificial image generation. You can progressively add noise to an image to create an extremely noisy image that are indistinguishable from pure noise. However, if we know the reverse process, we can perform a denoising to get the original image back. People have learned this reverse diffusion process and applied them to pure noise to get artificial images. "
