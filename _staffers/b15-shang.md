title: Weakly Supervised NLP
bio: "I’m an Assistant Professor at UCSD jointly appointed by Computer Science and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I obtained my Ph.D. from UIUC advised by Prof. Jiawei Han in 2019. I received my B.E. from SJTU in 2014. I’m also a coach of the UCSD’s ACM-ICPC team. My research focuses on data mining, NLP, and machine learning, with an emphasis on turning unstructured text data into structured knowledge and insights with minimum human effort. "
description: "We will play with massive text data and try to extract/discover interesting facts and findings without much human annotation effort. Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 will be our best friends to start with! Finding interesting applications of LLMs can be your capstone projects!"
summer: "Play with ChatGPT at least. Read some papers related to ChatGPT."

prerequisites: ML or data mining course experience. Heard about LLMs before. 
time: Wednesday 11AM-12PM, Zoom
style: I will lead the discussion in Fall and give mini-lectures. In Winter, it's more like stand-up meetings with Q&A.
