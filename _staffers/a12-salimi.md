title: Knowledge-Aware Causal Inference for Trustworthy Decision-Making using External Data Sources
bio: "My research interests are centered around advancing the field of trustworthy data analysis. I draw inspiration from my deep interest in data management, firmly believing that reliable, accessible, and well-organized data is essential for building trust in data analysis. In my research, I aim to develop methods for responsible data management and analysis to ensure transparency, fairness, reliability, and robustness in algorithmic decision-making. By adopting a data management perspective, I strive to create tools and techniques that enable human decision-makers to interpret data with greater accuracy and confidence. In my research group, we are dedicated to developing tools that enable human decision-makers with heterogeneous backgrounds to interpret data and make better-informed decisions."
description: "
The capstone project aims to develop a robust decision-making system that integrates data with external sources such as data lakes, open knowledge graphs, public databases, and web-based APIs. By leveraging causal inference techniques and incorporating diverse data sources, the project seeks to enhance the understanding of causal relationships between variables, ultimately leading to more trustworthy and effective decision-making processes. The project involves a comprehensive literature review, data collection and preprocessing, causal inference methodology, model development, evaluation, and real-world case study application, providing students with valuable experience and insights into the practical implications of knowledge-aware causal inference in decision-making."

prerequisites: None
time: Friday 12-1PM, Zoom
style: As a mentor, I plan to adopt a flexible mentoring style, integrating capstone students into a larger research group while providing personalized guidance and support. Depending on students' progress, I may involve my PhD students to offer additional expertise. My approach balances hands-on guidance with encouraging independent thinking, fostering an inclusive, supportive, and intellectually stimulating environment. I will remain the primary point of contact, ensuring consistency in the mentoring experience as students work towards achieving their project goals.
