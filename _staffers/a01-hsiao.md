title: Application of Deep Learning to Medical Imaging, Diagnosis and Management of Disease
bio: "Albert Hsiao is a San Diego native, completed a dual-major at Caltech in Biology and Engineering/Computer Science before returning to San Diego for medical school, joining the dual-degree MD-PhD Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). He is a graduate of the UCSD Bioengineering and Bioinformatics PhD programs, completing his thesis work with Shankar Subramaniam and Jerry Olefsky on the functional genomics of insulin resistance. He continued his post-graduate clinical training at Stanford in general surgery, diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology and cardiovascular imaging. While a clinical diagnostic radiology resident, he co-founded Arterys, Inc, a start-up company that developed a cloud-based medical imaging artificial intelligence platform and partnered with GE Healthcare to bring the 4D Flow MRI technology to market. He returned to UCSD as faculty in the Department of Radiology, where he continues to practice clinically and founded the Augmented imaging/Artificial intelligence Data Analytics (AiDA) laboratory to further build advanced imaging techniques for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease, infection and cancer.
"
description: "This group will investigate applications of deep learning to the characterization of medical images. This will likely focus principally on radiography (x-rays) for the two quarters, but the skill set developed by students will be broadly applicable to other higher-dimensional medical image data."
summer: "Review this previous paper. Students will replicate some of its results in the first quarter."
