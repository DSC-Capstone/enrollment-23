title: Estimation of Connectivity in the Human Brain Using Functional MRI Data
bio: "With an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I discovered statistics for my PhD and have been doing data science since then (even when it wasn't called by that name). Much of my work involves signal and image analysis, but I'm interested in many theoretical and applied problems, even philosophical. Outside of academia, I like doing music, dancing, swimming, and more."
description: "An important aspect of mapping and understanding the brain is to determine which parts are connected to which. Connections in the brain may be inferred by estimating the correlations between the time series of brain activity measured by functional MRI. In this project, we will learn how to estimate the brain connectivity structure by performing statistical analysis of the Human Connectome Project data."
summer: "The intention of the project is to replicate the default mode network paper (<a href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0504136102'>link</a>), which outlines two anticorrelated networks (task-positive and task-negative) that can be reliably detected in resting-state fMRI. Data from the HCP would be used to build region-to-region correlation matrices using the xDF method. Then the rows and columns of the correlation matrices would be grouped by network to visualize correlations within network and anticorrelations between networks. Additional reading material:

prerequisites: Probability and Statistics (e.g. CSE 103, ECE 109, MATH 180A, MATH 183, MATH 189)
time: Wednesday 3:30-4:30PM, In-Person üìç HDSI 138
style: Mentoring will involve data science PhD student Gabriel Riegner. Students are expected to take ownership over the project. This implies taking initiative in learning about the topic (from the assigned material and other sources), implementing the methods in code, being resourceful when needing help, and asking questions. Students are expected to put in their best effort, plan their time over the quarter, make substantial progress each week, report on it each week, and come up with an action plan for the next steps (as opposed to waiting for the mentor to give instructions). In other words, be independent, but ask for help when needed.
