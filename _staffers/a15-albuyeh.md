title: Distributed Systems for Financial and Behavioral Data
bio: "I'm a part-time lecturer at HDSI and a machine learning architect with eight years of experience in enterprise ML. My research interests include deep learning for tabular data (with a focus on time-series financial data), reproducible research infrastructure, and applying machine learning to political and social science problems. Outside of academia, I enjoy practicing mixed martial arts, playing racquetball, and exploring San Diego with my family. I'm passionate about data science and machine learning, and I'm looking forward to working with students who like solving interesting problems with machine learning."
description: "In this group, students will learn advanced techniques for building distributed systems to solve large-scale problems in finance, social science, and political science. We will start by exploring techniques for tabular data pre-processing, with a specific focus on time-series and categorical transformations. Students will learn how to apply these techniques to real-world financial and behavioral data sets, with a particular emphasis on reproducibility and scalability. In addition to learning about pre-processing, we will also explore frameworks for scaling workloads beyond a single machine, including Ray, Modin, and Spark. By the end of the course, students will have gained practical experience in enterprise-like workflows and scale, and will be able to tackle complex challenges in data science and computer engineering. To ensure that students are well-prepared for future careers, we will also cover collaborative approaches to code versioning and open source development. Students will learn how to build and contribute to open source applications, which will be hosted in public repositories like PyPI. At the conclusion of the course, students will have a robust addition to their portfolio and a deeper understanding of distributed systems for financial and behavioral data. They will be better-prepared to tackle complex data science and data engineering challenges in both academia and industry."
summer: "It will be helpful spending some time learning the linux command line, git, python packaging, and becoming familiar with an IDE like PyCharm or something similar. "
