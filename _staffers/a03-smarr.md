title: Time Series Data Science in Health
bio: "I studied neurological control of hormones in rodents until I got frustrated with how little we know about the humans we're supposedly modeling with these lab approaches. Then I got into wearable and ambient sensor data to study humans. That lead me to develop novel approaches for getting information out of multimodal timeseries data, and to apply my biological expertise to help health algorithms use more human-appropriate assumptions than most classic linear-based classifiers. Still doing that."
description: "Time series come from many places - different people, different sensors, different record systems, etc. How do we bring these together to tell a useful story about a health issue? Challenges exist in the analytics - how to best use these data to gain information; in UX/UI - how do you present the information to support human insights; in alignment - how do you integrate data into predictors when time resolution is different across sources; to parsing biological complexity - you and I are different, so what's the \"right\" signal look like?
Past groups have worked on developing classifiers from time series data, developing data integration systems for patients, and developing data-driven interfaces to support clinical decision making."
summer: "Please read and consider looking up methods from the following papers over the summer. 1 a month would be a very slow pace and yet enough to bring you in well warmed. I presume you're coming in with some familiarity of classifiers and networks, so this is more about the systems and needs beneath these layers.

<li><a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.1043704/full'>Bayesian networks, sex differences, data from phone surveys</a></li>

<li><a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78355-6/'>Biological rhythms, COVID-19, and low hanging fruit</a></li>
</ul>
Note that the very large COVID-19 related data set in my lab is a controlled government resource (which I hate but which is the law) so we will not work in that. We will use public datasets, published data sets along side papers, and donated patient data from collaborating clinics."

prerequisites: Some exposure to health systems and biology will be helpful, but you will succeed (and maybe learn more!) without this.
time: Wednesday 2-3PM, In-Person üìç <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RGNMnBuqdte9moRu7" style="color:white"> FAH 2101</a>
style: I plan to integrate the DSC team with the Bionengineering capstone team of similar domain interests. Each team will do its own work, but also be expected to complement and collaborate with the others in the domain.
