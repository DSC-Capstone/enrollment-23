title: Upscaling from Old, Boring Microbiome Data to New Data That Will Change the World
bio: "My lab develops microbiome technologies, both computational and in the lab. I cofounded the Earth Microbiome Project and the American Gut Project/Microsetta, and was heavily involved in the Human Microbiome Project. We have related both human and environmental microbiome states to many different variables of clinical, scientific and/or societal importance. I also run or in leadership of several of UCSD's COVID-19 safety programs."
description: "Traditionally, we have read out microbial communities using just one gene, the 16S rRNA, which acts as a. taxonomic marker. Newer technologies allow us to read out all the genes in a sample and increasingly to assemble complete genomes. However, we have legacy datasets of millions of samples that, if upscaled, could transform our understanding of systems relevant to climate, biofuels, biodiversity/extinction, and the human body (with indications ranging from cancer to neuropsychiatric disease). We are looking for students interested in applying transformer or other advanced models to push the limits of what we can obtain from the old datasets, ground-truthed with some of the largest new microbiome datasets currently being generated in the world."
summer: "We primarily use Python. Please familiarize yourself with PyTorch, Qiita, and QIIME2. My Coursera course \"Gut Check\" and my TED talk are rather dated but give a sense of what we're trying to do overall."

prerequisites: None
time: Wednesday 3-4PM, In-Person
style: "Will involve PhD students and/or postdocs depending on what direction group takes, although I plan to be there every session except when unavoidable (e.g. travel). I usually allow several weeks to explore the general area then either encourage the team to focus on a project of their choosing or provide more directed guidance. The 2021 capstone project led to the campus wastewater dashboard we all use here: <a href='https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html'>https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html</a>"
