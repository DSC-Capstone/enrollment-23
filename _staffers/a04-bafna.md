title: Characterizing Extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer
bio: "I am a faculty member at UCSD since 2003, working in bioinformatics. My current research interests include 2 topics: Cancer Genomics, and Genomics for biodiversity. In a past life, I worked on he human genome project at a startup."
description: "Extrachromosomal DNA are formed when DNA breaks off from the chromosome, and circularizes. EcDNA evolve independently and can rapidly increase the number of cancer promoting genes leading to highly pathological cancers. In this project, we will look at images of tissues with the goal of identifying and separating individual nucleii as a precursor to identification of ecDNA. Students should be self-starting, have an interest in biology (some knowledge is helpful but not required), and be prepared to curate messy datasets through interactive tools. "
summer: "Summer is a great time to start. Interested students should contact me towards the end of May. We will provide some reading and a plan for summer to interested students."
