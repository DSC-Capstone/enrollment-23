title: Graph ML for Chip Profiling
bio: "Lindsey is a Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Qualcomm where she has led multiple projects in ML-based CAD/EDA which have impacted global SoC design process for teams across the globe leading to significant savings in time-to-market, compute and NRE cost; consults on a variety of ML-driven initiatives in applications ranging from digital and analog design to 5G to licensing to standards and holds one granted and five pending patents related to this work. In 2021, she was honored by the Global Semiconductor Association (GSA) as the inaugural Female Up-And-Comer. Prior to joining Qualcomm, Lindsey was a 4-year scholarship athlete at Stanford University where she won two tennis national team championships. After graduating with distinction in Economics, she obtained her master’s degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University where she pursued research in deep representation learning for Chris Re and Jure Leskovic. Her current research interests are in the intersection of ML and constrained optimization, human-centered AI, graph ML, and generative models. Beyond her technical work, Lindsey is president of Qualcomm Women in Machine Learning and devotes much of her free time to helping mentor & develop young engineers. She is also passionate about cooking and sports/athletics, in particular tennis, boxing, biking, running, hiking, and dance. "
description: "Machine Learning is becoming an increasingly necessary technique in the design of chips due to the end of Moore’s Law and the increased complexity of the process, functionality requirements, and design time limits. A circuit represents a complex graph with unique properties that do not exist in more common graph ML applications such as those for social networks or biologic entities. As a result, graph machine learning offers a powerful set of techniques to understand the fundamental properties of the chip design and thereby create better designs more quickly. This capstone will expose students to graph algorithms and graph ML through the exploration of unsupervised learning on chip designs and equip them with the skills to tackle arbitrary graph modeling tasks."
summer: "Students should be familiar with a deep learning framework. Recommendation is for pytorch

The following resources are helpful for any students looking to get a headstart on graph ML or better understand the domain of application

oldstudent: nan
prerequisites: "Deep learning; deep learning frameworks such as pytorch or tensorflow
Helpful, but not required: graph algorithms; graph theory; ASIC/FPGA/VLSI design"
time: Monday 1-2PM, In-Person
style: We plan to have ~5 industry mentors who will bring a mix of ML, SW, and domain of application experience as well as experience in different types of professional roles and years on the job. Seminar sessions will be a mix of technical tutorials and paper readings w/ discussion, with a rotation of the mentor leading each week's session. We seek to have highly interactive sessions where students come prepared to discuss that weeks topic. Mentors will look to students to define project topics and research plans, but actively advise these decisions as well as the technical project implemention.
