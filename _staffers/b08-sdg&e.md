title: Utility and Wildfire Risks Detected From Street View Imagery
bio: "Dr. Phi Nguyen is a senior data scientist at San Diego Gas & Electric, where he leads the Data Science Center of Excellence. Dr. Nguyen graduated from UCSD with a Ph. D. in materials science and engineering, where he developed nanomaterials for clean energy applications. He has worked for several years as a consultant in the energy sector, where his focus was on using data to support policies that promote clean energy and energy efficiency. Dr. Nguyen joined SDG&E to focus on developing models to mitigate wildfire risk in California and has since expanded his work to other areas that benefit San Diego communities."
description: "San Diego Gas & Electric leverages many different public and private data sources to make critical decisions that impact our communities. We would like to explore Google Street View as a publicly available source of data to help us identify risks that can be observed from the perspective of San Diego citizens. The project goals are to quantify the ability to observe damaged assets or fire from commonly traveled paths, determine whether there are clear compliance infractions that can be seen from the citizen's perspective, and identify other utility-related hazards that can be seen from this public data source."
summer: "Review Google street view API documentation: <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview'>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview</a>; any image detection experience"

prerequisites: None
time: Wednesdays, TBD, Hybrid
style: Student group will be a stand-alone unit at SDG&E led by Mentor. Mentor will first work with students to understand utility space, and then schedule time with other SDG&E staff who will provide tours, field visits, and other utility-specific training. Students will also be introduced to other data scientists and engineers at SDG&E who are available for support on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of the project. However, once an introduction is made, it will be up to the students to reach out to staff when support is needed. Students will be encouraged to run their ideas by staff members beyond the mentor.
