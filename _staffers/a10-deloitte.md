title: Ethical Considerations in Using Artificial Intelligence
bio: "Deloitte Senior Manager/Specialist Leader leading Deloitte's Trustworthy AI product and service offering on applying ethical principles in the development, validation and use of Artificial Intelligence. Background within economics, financial services, banking and capital market as an industry practitioner as well as professional advisor, and is currently advising several U.S. Government agencies on AI and ethical AI."
description: "There is a growing societal concern over the potential and real negative effects of AI, particularly in terms of fairness and explainability. This concern is considered in this course where students will study high-profile cases of algorithmic discrimination, explore different definitions and metrics of AI fairness, and understand their practical implications. The challenge lies in translating these complex concepts into real-world applications, training students to independently analyze AI fairness and explainability, and emphasizing the societal impact of these issues. The course aims to equip students with skills to assess algorithmic fairness, understand data limitations, and apply bias mitigation techniques in AI models.
Students will explore the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on fairness assessments and bias mitigation. This course integrates practical workshops, case studies, include IBM AI Fairness 360 Model Overview and the evaluation of model bias using Medical Expenditure data. Through lectures, workshops, readings, and hands-on projects, students will gain an understanding of how to assess algorithmic fairness, measure fairness metrics, and identify the limitations of data in capturing fairness. They will also learn techniques for mitigating bias in AI models through pre-, in-, and post-processing. The course will emphasize real-world applications and the impact of ethical AI considerations on different stakeholders. Students will engage in replication projects and independent analyses to develop their skills in fairness assessments and bias mitigation."

style: "The capstone program is based in active participation from all students. The mentors will provide overall guidance, and a high level of student independence is required. Highlights:
<ul>
<li>Understand the implications of the impossibility theorem for organizations employing AI</li>
<li>Develop ethical AI models considering data-specific issues and fairness metrics</li>
<li>Explore pre, in, and postprocessing techniques for mitigating fairness issues</li>
<li>Analyze the impact of non-technical considerations on the ethical impacts of AI</li>
<li>Investigate ethical considerations across different industries and AI techniques</li>
<li>Examine the perspectives of stakeholders and the implications of false classifications</li>
<li>Utilize the AI Fairness 360 Model and Medical Expenditure data for practical projects</li>
<li>Gain insights into data science project management and collaboration within AI teams</li>
