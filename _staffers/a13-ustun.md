title: Learning Simple Integer Risk Scores for Clinical Applications
bio: "My research combines machine learning, optimization, and human-centered design. I develop methods to promote the responsible use of machine learning in medicine, consumer finance, and the physical sciences. In particular, I study topics like algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and personalization. I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, and Bachelors degrees in Operations Research and Economics from UC Berkeley."
description: "Risk scores are simple classification models that let users make quick predictions by adding or subtracting a few small numbers. These simple models are deceptively difficult to learn from data: they must be sparse, have small integer coefficients, and obey application-specific constraints (e.g., on usability or interpretability). Scoring systems are readily adopted in medicine because they are easy to use and understand (see e.g., 500+ medical models at MDCalc.com). However, most of them are built heuristically â€“ by combining multiple approaches. In this project, we will build risk scores using new methods like RiskSLIM and FasterRisk."

oldstudent: nan
prerequisites: You should have completed DSC140A and taken another machine learning course. You will need a background in optimization for machine learning. You *must* be comfortable coding in Python and R, working with new packages, training models on a cluster, and debugging your own code.
time: Friday 8-9AM, Zoom
style: We'll meet every week and use the time to check in on your projects. I will work with you directly, rather than involving students and postdocs.
seats: 6
tag: Causal Inference and Fairness
