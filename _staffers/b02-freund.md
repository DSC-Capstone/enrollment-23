title: Bird Song Analysis and Classification with an Emphasis on Active Learning
bio: "30 years research in machine learning, in particular, learning theory. Interested in applications of ML to problems in Biology."
description: "Bird songs are a rich area attracting many professionals and amateurs. The ornatology in Cornell (<a href='https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/'>https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/</a>) is a leader in electronic resources for bird song identification, including
<ul>
<li><a href='https://ebird.org/home'>https://ebird.org/home</a> - a home in which thousands of world wide volunteers contribute bird identifications</li>
<li><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/merlin-bird-id-by-cornell-lab/id773457673'>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/merlin-bird-id-by-cornell-lab/id773457673</a> - an app for bird identification</li></ul>
Beyond Cornell, there are many additional efforts in bird song identification, including the BirdClef Kaggle competition: <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2023'>https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2023</a>
<br>
Locally in UCSD Scripps Oceanography, the Hildebrand lab (<a href='https://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/people/JohnHildebrand.html'>https://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/people/JohnHildebrand.html</a>) has been collecting continuous bird songs for the last three years. Analyzing this continuous recording from a single site is a new challenge that can shed light on the behaviour of birds in the wild.
"
summer: "Obtain the code for the top contenders in Kaggle, as well as the latest version of birdnet. Reproduce some of the top results."
