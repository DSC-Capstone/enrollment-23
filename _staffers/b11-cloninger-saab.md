<li>Rayan Saab is an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department and at the Halicioglu Data Science Institute. He works on developing computational methods and theory for solving problems related to collecting, processing, and analyzing data. He came to this work first through an undergrad degree in electrical engineering and finding himself always interested in both making things work and understanding why they do.

description: "In the fast evolving field of digital image generation, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique to create high-quality synthetic images, as well as other structured signals. They do so by leveraging training data to implicitly learn the underlying distribution and guide the generative process. In the case of images, for example, they effectively deconstruct and reconstruct images using a combination of carefully designed stochastic processes, probabilistic models, and deep neural networks. The domain of this project encompasses the basic theoretical foundations of diffusion models as well as their practical applications in generating visually compelling results. Students who choose this project will delve into the mathematical and computational principles behind diffusion-based methods, exploring concepts such as stochastic processes, partial differential equations, and probabilistic models. They will also engage in hands-on coding and experimentation with diffusion models, applying them to various datasets and signal models. "
summer: "Here are some relevant readings. The students needs not go into all the mathematical details of the papers as we can go through them together, but these papers give an idea of the domain. The more familiar they are with the topic, the more we can do!

One objective of the replication project could be to recreate the numerics in the third paper (Sohl-Dickstein et al.)"

prerequisites: Having a course or two on probability and/or machine learning would be very helpful -- in particular, being familiar with Bayes' rule and conditional probabilities (or being willing to learn very quickly). Familiarity with the basics of neural networks would also be very helpful. 
time: Thursday 12:30-1:30PM, In-Person
style: We both are relatively hands-on in the sense that we make ourselves available for problem-solving and discussions. That said, students have to be self-motivated, and motivated to do the readings and the work.
