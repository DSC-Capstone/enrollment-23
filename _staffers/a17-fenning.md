title: Graph Database Solutions for Solar Cell Manufacturing
bio: "David P. Fenning is an associate professor in NanoEngineering at UC San Diego, where he directs the Solar Energy Innovation Laboratory (SOLEIL). His group researches materials for solar energy conversion and storage. Currently, his work focuses on defects and reliability in silicon and hybrid perovskite solar cells and CO2 electrocatalysis for solar fuels.

After completing his Ph.D. on silicon solar cell materials at MIT in 2013, he worked with the silicon R&D team at 1366 Technologies Inc., followed by an MIT/Battelle postdoctoral fellowship in solar fuels. He joined the NanoEngineering Department at UC San Diego in 2015.

He is a recipient of the American Chemical Society's PRF New Investigator award and was recognized as a 2017 Hellman Fellow. His research is supported by the DOE SunShot Initiative and the California Energy Commission."
description: "We are interested in developing models to predict the efficiency and durability of next-generation solar cells from early measures of material quality, before the solar cell is even made. We will have data from several timepoints during the fabrication of the solar cell starting with the raw material, then more data about the expected performance as we add each layer of the cell, until we have an actual solar cell that we can measure the efficiency of. We want to determine which measurements and at what timepoints are most valuable to predicting solar efficiency. Similarly, we will expose the solar cells to operation in simulated sunlight and we would like to build models to predict the durability of performance from the material-level data, establishing predictive quality even before we've compelted solar cell."
