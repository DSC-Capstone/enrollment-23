bio: "Zhiting Hu is an Assistant Professor in Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. He received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2014, and his Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. His research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and ML systems. In particular, He is interested in principles, methodologies, and systems of training AI agents with all types of experiences (data, symbolic knowledge, rewards, adversaries, lifelong interplay, etc), and their applications in controllable text generation, healthcare, and other application domains. His research was recognized with best demo nomination at ACL2019 and outstanding paper award at ACL2016."
description: "We'll explore, design and, develop useful machine learning/natural language processing tools for either general ML/NLP research problems (such as reinforcement learning) or specific application domains (such as processing medical text data). We hope to make the tools open-source and hence contribute to the research/industry communities. Given the limited time, we will base our tools on popular infrastures like Huggingface, AutoGPT, etc."
summer: "Get familiar with deep learning tools like PyTorch and NLP tools like Huggingface"

prerequisites: Natural Language Processing
time: Tuesday 2-3PM, In-Person üìç HDSI 138
style: The mentor will provide a couple of candidate projects; each student group is expected to either pick one of the projects or define their own project by themselves. During the project, the mentor will provide relevant materials (papers, tools, etc.) and necessary guidance when there are questions; students are expected to carry out the projects largely independently. There are also possibilities that students can choose to join a larger research group led by the mentor's PhD students.
