title: "Stochastic Optimization in Over-Parameterized Models: Neural Networks and Kernel Machines"
bio: "<ul><li>Yian Ma: I am an assistant professor at the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute and an affliated faculty member at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of University of California San Diego. Prior to UCSD, I spent a year as a visiting faculty at Google Research. Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow at EECS, UC Berkeley and completed my Ph.D. at University of Washington. My current research primarily revolves around scalable inference methods for credible machine learning. This involves designing Bayesian inference methods to quantify uncertainty in the predictions of complex models; understanding computational and statistical guarantees of inference algorithms; and leveraging these scalable algorithms to learn from time series data and perform sequential decision making tasks.</li></ul>"
description: "Stochastic optimization has been the main powerhouse for modern machine learning. In particular, one needs to tune the optimization methods for the over-parametrized models such as deep neural networks or kernel machines. During this capstone project, we will explore how to train those over-parametrized models with stochastic gradient descent and its variants. We will also study interesting phenomena arising from such technical problems."
summer: "Please finish reading the following 3 papers during the summer. Pick one to go into the nitty gritty details. Close to the beginning of the quarter, prepare a short presentation about the paper. You can either use slides or prepare to present it on the whiteboard with the fellow students who pick the same paper.
