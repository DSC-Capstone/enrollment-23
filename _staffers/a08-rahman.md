title: Modeling Mental Health with Mobile and Wearable Data
bio: "Tauhidur Rahman is an Assistant Professor in the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute at the University of California San Diego where he directs the Mobile Sensing and Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory (MOSAIC Lab). His current research focuses on building novel ubiquitous and mobile health sensing technologies that capture observable low-level physical signals in the form of an acoustic and electromagnetic wave from our bodies and surrounding environments and map them to relevant biological and behavioral measurements. Some of his notable accomplishments include a Google Research Scholar Award in 2023, a Google Ph.D. fellowship in 2016 in mobile computing, a finalist position in Qualcomm innovation fellowship in 2015, Outstanding Teaching Award 2015 from Cornell University, one best paper award in ACM Digital Health 2016, one best paper honorable mention award in ACM Ubicomp 2015 and a distinguished paper award from ACM IMWUT in 2021. His work has been featured in several US-based and International media outlets including Wall Street Journal, MIT Technology Review, NewScientist, Public Television for Western New England, Daily Mail (UK) and Hindustan Times (India). His laboratory has been funded by NSF, NIH, DARPA and industry grants."
description: "The group will develop machine learning models for Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development with multimodal data including brain imaging, physiological sensor data, self-reports. Prof. Rahman will make the data available to the students for this secondary analysis."
summer: "The students are encouraged to get some familiarity with time series modeling and machine learning fundamentals."
