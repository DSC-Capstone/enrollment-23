title: Handling Long Range Interactions in Graph Neural Networks 
bio: "<ul><li>Gal Mishne's research is on geometric data analysis. My research focuses on modeling data as lying on a graph or being sampled from a (nonlinear) manifold, and developing methods that take this geometry into account in order to process, analyze, and visualize high-dimensional data. My research group primarily collaborates with neuroscientists and other biomedical researchers, to apply our models and methods to real-world data.</li><li>Yusu Wang's research primarily focuses on geometric and topological data analysis. I am particularly interested in developing effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data / shape analysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods, as well as to integrate such methods with machine learning frameworks. I aim to both provide theoretical understanding of various computational methods developed, and to apply them to practical domains, including computational biology, computational neuroanatomy, material science, computer graphics and visualization.</li></ul>"
description: "Graph data are ubiquitous in a broad range of applications. Recently, we have witnessed the tremendous use and success of various versions of graph neural networks (GNNs) in analyzing and learning on graph data. However, the popular architecture of GNNs have difficulty in effectively aggregating information along long range interactions (e.g, between nodes that are far away in the graph). In particular, as the graph becomes larger, it is well-known that some popular GNN architectures have issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing. Being able to effectively capturing / learning based on long-range interactions in graphs is one of the most important challenges faced in graph learning. More recently, graph transformer type of architecture has gain popularity in handling long range interactions as well. But they have various limitations (including scalability). The goal of this group is to learn and run some SOTA GNN models, and aims to develop some strategies to improve their ability in capturing long range interaction in input graphs.

summer: "check out pytorch geometric (<a href='https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>)"
oldstudent: https://brliu.com/dsc180b-project
prerequisites: Students should be familiar with neural network architectures and have done projects on deep learning. Knowledge of graph neural networks will be a plus but not required. 
time: Wednesday 9-10AM, In-Person
style: We expect students to be self motivated to do the reading and coding tasks, and to have some degree of independence in their capstone projects. Students are expected to treat the project seriously and devote time to making weekly progress toward their goals. We are always happy to discuss and help problem-solve.
