title: Precision Genomics with Personalized Genetic Risk Prediction
bio: "I'm a junior faculty member at UCSD jointly appointed at the Halicioglu Data Science Institute and the Department of Medicine (Division of Biomedical Informatics). I am a statistical geneticist and am interested in studying the genetic regulation of gene expression for the purpose of understanding human disease and complex traits. I received my undergrad degree in Biological Engineering at MIT, my PhD in Bioinformatics at Harvard Medical School, and completed my postdoctoral research in statistical genetics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Now that I live in San Diego, I enjoy playing beach volleyball and hiking in the canyons with my dog! "
description: "A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a weighted sum of an individual‚Äôs risk alleles across one‚Äôs genome for a particular phenotype, i.e. disease or other measurement. The weights are typically the effect sizes of the risk allele, estimated by a genome-wide association study (in the case of complex traits / polygenic diseases) or an eQTL study (in the case of gene expression). PRS have great potential to revolutionize preventive care. In theory, an individual may arrive at the clinic not knowing their genetic susceptibility to a disease, have their DNA sequenced, and learn what is their lifetime risk for the disease. There is a theoretical liability threshold of PRS at which individuals who have a PRS value lower than the threshold will not develop the disease and those with a value higher than the threshold will develop disease. For diseases with a monogenic basis, it has been shown that the same degree of disease risk can be conferred by polygenic risk alone (Khera 2018 Nature Genetics). PRS are generally useful for understanding how predictive genetics is of disease and how disperse the genetic contributions are. PRS is especially useful in understanding genetic liability when individual effects are too small to be easily detected by genome-wide association studies (Purcell 2009 Nature). In this capstone, students will use population genetics and genomics data to assess individual risk for disease outcomes and transcriptomic measurements. Students will learn to work with genotype data from 1000Genomes and genetic association data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)."

style: For the first quarter, we will meet as one group as we are gaining familiarity with the core concepts of precision medicine and personalized genetic risk scores. For the second quarter, I will be separately with each project group. Students will work with publicly available datasets and will be doing all the analysis on their own. Typical analysis will begin with acquiring VCF or plink files for genetic data. Students will be expected to work on a remote server and use plink (a convenient tool with great documentation) to manipulate files, perform pruning and thresholding, and make disease predictions across individuals. Students will be expected to use R or python to visualize their results and assess their statistical significance.
