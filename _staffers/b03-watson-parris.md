title: Deep Learning for Climate Model Emulation
bio: "Duncan Watson-Parris is an atmospheric physicist working at the interface of climate research and machine learning to investigate the effect of air-pollution on the climate. Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques to combine global models with satellite data his group looks to better understand complex aerosol-climate interactions and improve projections of climate change. He recently moved to San Diego from Oxford, England and enjoys soccer, chess and role-play games but is currently learning to surf!"
description: "The choices humanity makes in the next few decades will determine how much warmer the Earth will be by the end of the century, with implications for billions of lives and trillions of dollars in GDP. Many different emission pathways exist that are compatible with the Paris climate agreement, and many more are possible that miss that target. While some of the most complex climate models have simulated a small selection of these, it is impractical to use these computationally expensive models to fully explore the space of possibilities or assess all the associated risks. Our lab has recently developed state-of-the-art climate model emulators to enable fast, accurate and reliable predictions for any given scenario (<a href='https://github.com/duncanwp/ClimateBench'>https://github.com/duncanwp/ClimateBench</a>). This project will extend this work by incorporating multiple climate models at different levels of fidelity to provide high-resolution predictions with robust uncertainties for improved decision making."
