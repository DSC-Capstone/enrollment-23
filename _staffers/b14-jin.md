title: Investigating the Impact of Input Methods on Human Language Evolution
bio: "I'm an Assistant Professor in Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Computer Science and Engineering (affiliate) at UC San Diego. Our lab, Data Smith Lab, studies the security and privacy of data systems by researching the people who design, implement, and use these systems. I am interested in topics ranging from human-computer interaction, mobile computing, security & privacy, programming language, database, and software engineering."
description: "This project aims to investigate the relationship between input methods and the evolution of human language. Specifically, we will explore how the auto-suggestions and corrections provided by input methods can impact the vocabulary of each user. The project will focus on multiple languages, which have undergone significant changes in input methods over the past few decades.
<br>
More specifically, we will analyze the effect of input methods on the vocabulary usage of different language users. We also want to investigate whether using input methods leads to the gradual disappearance of certain words and phrases. Finally, we aim to examine input methods' impact on human language's evolution and the potential limitations it poses to human thought."
summer: "During the summer, students are expected to identify potential datasets and input methods and learn some knowledge about language evolution (e.g., <a href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.96.14.8028'>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.96.14.8028</a>)."
