title: "Semantic Search: Deep Learning Meets Information Retrieval"
bio: "I'm a data scientist at Stitch Fix, where I build search and recommender systems.  It is extremely gratifying to use data and math to help so many people make better decisions."
description: "This section offers a hands-on exploration of semantic search, focusing on applications beyond traditional web search, such as code search, e-commerce, and file search. In the first quarter, students will reproduce results from a recent paper on semantic search for code, gaining practical experience in implementing state-of-the-art techniques. The second quarter will involve a group project, where students collaborate to develop their own innovative search solution in a domain of their choice. This capstone emphasizes the importance of constructing functional systems and applying the latest advancements in deep learning and large language models to improve search accuracy and efficiency. "
summer: "Please get a copy of \"AI-Powered Search\" by Trey Grainger, Doug Turnbull, and Max Irwin. The publisher, Manning, often has sales on the eBook.  I strongly recommend skimming the whole thing, but if you at lease look through Section 1 it will help us all have a shared foundation."
