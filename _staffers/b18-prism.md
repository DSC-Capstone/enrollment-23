description: "One of the most widely used and little understood parts of the Financial Services industry is the credit score. In this course, students will work with transactional bank data to build statistical models for the purpose of assessing creditworthiness in the financial services industry. The course will take students through the life of a model development project, from data exploration, through model training and evaluation. Students will have the opportunity to work with both structured and unstructured data as they learn about the process and attributes that go into credit scores. Additionally, students will learn about the importance of model explainability and fairness."
summer: "The course will focus on translating data in your bank account eventually in a credit score.  In preparation for the course, it is recommended students familiarize themselves with NLP techniques for text classification.  We will be first building a model to categorize banking transactions, then using the categorized transactions to eventually build a credit score."
